                <h1>About School</h1>

                <div class="view">
                   <p> ABC School, one of the oldest International Schools in the country was founded in 1985. Situated at 232, Baudhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7. Wycherley boasts of 30 years of academic excellence that has resulted in exemplary achievements of our students, with quality education, on par with global standards. Wycherley is also the First and Only Comprehensive Centre for Cambridge Education from Year 1 to Year 13 in Sri Lanka.

The School teaches English not as a foreign language but as a unifying agent that draws together students from a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society. It has the right ambience that unites Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim, Malay, Burgher and even foreign students.The Principal of Wycherley is Mr. Kingsley Jayasinghe who is not only a Chemistry Teacher par excellence but a very strict disciplinarian too. The Foundation of Wycherley is built on Tradition, Simplicity and Discipline. "Success through discipline" is what Wycherley always aims at. The Principal has always had a vision to make Wycherley a truly "National School" illustrative of the Global Village Concept.

When Wycherley reached the ten year milestone in 1996, the population touched a thousand. The name of Wycherley has always been kept shining with excellent London Ordinary Level and London Advanced Level Examination results. Wycherley follows the Cambridge System of Examinations based on the British Educational System.

When the world heralded the “New Millennium” in 2001, Wycherley had reached its fifteenth anniversary. The school has forged ahead with a concept of racial and religious harmony which is cemented by a common medium of instruction- English. Recently a Don at Cambridge remarked “We need more students from Wycherley” and that speaks volumes for this hallowed institution.

                   <p> Wycherley International School follows a Complete Cambridge Curriculum from UKG (Year 1) right up to the A/Levels. Cambridge Education is at the forefront of research into educational best practices and is geared to deliver the highest quality school education. The educational assessment is based on 150 years of research and accumulated expertise. The World is subject to constant changes and so Cambridge International Programmes also change with it. Today, education is about teaching students the skills they need to succeed in fast paced and competitive societies. ICT Starters is now part of the educational experience worldwide. It is regarded as a new literacy alongside reading, writing and numeracy.

                    With this in mind, I am indeed proud to mention that we now have 5 Cambridge subjects included in our syllabuses, viz English, Mathematics, Science, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Global Perspectives. These subjects will be covered by high quality assessments though Cambridge International Examinations (CIE).
                    
                    Every parent desires to give the best in Education to their children. The choice of the School is the prime factor that helps to put the child on the correct track for his or her future. We at Wycherley, focus on building an International School, which is also truly Sri Lankan in outlook and strive to give our children correct values in life.
